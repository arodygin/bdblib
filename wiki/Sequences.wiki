= Create/open sequence =

Sequence is a simple way to get a generator of unique IDs inside your database. You can have as much sequences as you want.

Like a database (and any other DBO, actually) you can either open existing sequence (which must be already created before), or create a new one (which will raise an exception if a sequence already exists).

To create new sequence:

{{{
#include <bdb.h>

int main ()
{
    bdb::database db("C:\\mydbdir");
    bdb::sequence* seq = db.add_sequence("myseq", true);
    ...
}
}}}

To open existing sequence use *false* in the last parameter (or just skip it, since it's optional and is *false* by default).

= Using sequence =

A sequence generates 64-bit integer values in increment manner starting from *1*. To generate next ID just call the *bdb::sequence::id()* function (which always return different ID, of course):

{{{
#include <bdb.h>

int main ()
{
    bdb::database db("C:\\mydbdir");
    bdb::sequence* seq = db.add_sequence("myseq");
    ...
    int64_t id = seq->id();
    ...
}
}}}
